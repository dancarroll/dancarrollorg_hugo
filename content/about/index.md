What I do
---------
I'm an experienced full-stack software engineering lead, having worked across a wide range of products including backend serving
infrastructure, frontend APIs, web apps, and both desktop and mobile application development. I am currently working at [Google][google]
on [Google Play Games for PC][gpgpc] ðŸŽ®. I led the team that built and launched the storefront client and installation flow.

I also spent time at Google working on the [Play Games Android app][gpg], [Play Store][playstore], and [Play for Education][gpfe]. Prior to
Google, I was working at Microsoft in the [Office][office] organization. I worked on the [Outlook][outlook] platform,
[SharePoint][sharepoint], and SkyDrive Pro (now called [OneDrive for Business][skydrivepro]).

My interests
------------
In my free time, which this blog will primarily concern, I have a number of hobbies and engage in a number of activities.

On the technical side, my primary programming expertise is in Java, C#, and Dart. This website initially served as a chance to experiment with
Python, using the [Django web development framework][django]. This site also gave me an opportunity to dive much deeper into HTML and CSS,
during a time in my career where I was not doing web development. It has long since transitioned to a static site generator, so that it is easy
to host the content wherever is convenient.

Outside of technology, I am an avid runner, having completed many half-marathons over the past two decades. In past, I was also a casual
golfer and squash player -- pursuits which I hope to get back to in the future. I enjoy gaming and play when I can across the Xbox, Switch, and
PC platforms (most recently using the Steam Deck for the latter). My favorite game series are [Fallout][fallout], [Mass Effect][masseffect],
and [Forza][forza] (especially the Horizon games). My favorite game developers are [Remedy][remedy] and [Zachtronics][zachtronics].

I am a licensed amateur radio operator under the call sign W1DJC, though I do not take advantage of the privileges as often as I wish.
My favorite brewery is [Allagash][allagash].
