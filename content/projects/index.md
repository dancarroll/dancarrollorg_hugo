I currently have my open source projects [hosted on GitHub][github].

[dancarrollorg_hugo][dc_hugo]: This site's code, primarily written in Markdown and YAML and generated using [Hugo][hugo].

[aoc_2024][aoc2024]: Solutions to the 2024 [Advent of Code][aoc], written in Dart.

[dart_clique][dart_clique]: Implementation of the Bronâ€“Kerbosch algorithm in Dart, which was an offshoot from an Advent of Code problem.

[qmk_bongo][qmk_bongo]: Utility code to be used from [QMK][qmk] to add an animation of [Bongo Cat][bongocat] to a keyboard's OLED display.

[dancarrollorg_django][dc_django]: Old version of this site, written in Python using the [Django web framework][django]

[django-activitysync][activitysync]: Social activity aggregator for Django projects, which was used on the old version of this site.

[sitemap-diff][sitemap]: Simple C# console app for diffing two sitemaps -- very helpful when switching to a new site framework, to
ensure all URLs remain consistent (pet peeve of mine when old URLs break -- looking at you, Microsoft MSDN!).
